## Overview

goalie is an R package designed to provide a simple interface for extracting data from the United Nations Statistics Divisions (UNSD) [Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) API](https://unstats.un.org/SDGAPI/swagger/). The package allows for exploration of SDG data contained within, including available dimensions/attributes and geographic coverage, while providing a simple tool to extract all data quickly into R.

* `sdg_overview()`, `sdg_targets()`,  and `sdg_indicators()` provide data frames covering the [goals, targets, and indicators of the SDGs](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/Global%20Indicator%20Framework%20after%202020%20review_Eng.pdf).
* `sdg_dimensions()` and `sdg_attributes()` provides a data frame of dimensions
 and attributes available for a specific SDG or series of data.
* `sdg_series()` provides a list of all data series available in the SDG database.
* `sdg_geoareas()` provides an overview of geographic areas covered by data in the SDG database,
or that have data for a specific SDG goal, target, indicator, or series.
* `sdg_geoarea_data()` lists the SDG data available for a specific geographic area.
* `sdg_data()` extracts data for a selection of series in the GHO and outputs all results in a single data frame.

The interface is designed to be as simple as possible, only requiring input of the code of an indicator to extract it.
However, at request, more detailed implementation of the SDG API's systems can be implemented. Please provide
any requests through the [Github issues page](https://github.com/gpw13/goalie/issues).

goalie can be installed using `remotes::install_github("gpw13/goalie")`
